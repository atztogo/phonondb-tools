Phonon database at 2017-06-21
==============================

Initial crystal structures used to calculate data in this section were
obtained from the Materials Project using pymatgen. The reference and
citation information about Materials Project, pymatgen, crystal
structures are found at :ref:`crystal_structure_and_citation`.

The data are generated by automated first-principles phonon
calculations. Basically these data in every entry are not well
examined, therefore some are considered wrong.

The characters "bdt" besides the compound names show available plots
of phonon band structure (b), phonon-DOS (d), thermal properties at
constant volume (t), respectively.
